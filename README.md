# Inventory Management System

## 1. Introduction

### Objective
Developing an advanced Inventory Management System with NestJS and PostgreSQL.

### Overview
This system aims to streamline inventory management processes, providing a solution for businesses to efficiently handle product tracking, stock levels, sales, and transactions.

## 2. Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Back-End**: NestJS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, TypeORM
- **Micro-services**: RabbitMQ for communication
- **Real-Time Communication**: Socket.IO
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Payments**: Stripe
- **Additional Features**: QR code generation, OTP for password resets, PDF generation, email notifications

## 3. Micro-services Architecture
A micro-services architecture is an approach where an application is built as a collection of small, independent services. Each service represents a specific business functionality and can be developed and scaled independently.

- **Scalability**: Individual services can be scaled independently based on demand.
- **Resilience**: A failure in one micro-service doesnâ€™t bring down the entire application.
- **Flexibility**: Teams can use different technologies, programming languages, or databases for different services.
- **Faster Development**: Different teams can work on different micro-services concurrently, speeding up development.

## 4. Why PostgreSQL?

### Introduction
PostgreSQL is an open-source, highly reliable, and feature-rich relational database.

### Reasons for Choosing PostgreSQL
- **Reliability**: Renowned for its robustness, perfect for handling complex transactions.
- **ACID Compliance**: Ensures data integrity, essential for inventory management.
- **Advanced Features**: Supports a wide range of data types, including JSON, XML, hstore (key-value pairs), and user-defined types. It also allows custom functions, operators, and index types.
- **Scalability**: Efficiently scales to accommodate growing application demands.

## 5. Service Breakdown
- **Inventory Micro-service**: Manages products, payments, stock, sales, orders, returns, and transactions, including real-time updates.
- **Company Micro-service**: Handles authentication, user management, clients, units, and utility features like pagination.
- **Gateway**: Centralized entry point managing routing, role guards, and auth guards.

## 6. Real-Time Features with Socket.IO

### Introduction to Socket.IO
- **Overview**: Enables real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and servers.
- **Advantages**: Provides immediate feedback, enhancing user experience and operational efficiency.

### Implementation
- **Real-Time Sales Updates**: Reflect new sales across the system instantly.
- **Real-Time Stock Management**: Update stock levels in real-time as inventory changes occur.

### Benefits
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Users receive immediate updates without needing to refresh.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Real-time data ensures all stakeholders have up-to-date information.

## 7. API Documentation with Swagger UI

### Introduction to Swagger
Swagger UI provides an interactive interface for visualizing and interacting with APIs.

### Benefits
- **Ease of Use**: Facilitates API documentation, testing, and interaction.
- **Living Documentation**: Automatically updates as the API evolves.

## 8. Payment Integration (Stripe)

### Stripe Integration
Stripe is a powerful and flexible payment processing platform that allows businesses to handle online payments securely and efficiently.

### QR Code in Payments
Demonstration of QR code generation for payment processes.

## 9. Backup and Database Management

### Database Backup
Database backup is a critical aspect of data management, ensuring data remains safe, secure, and recoverable in case of unexpected events.

### Database Health Checker
Monitoring PostgreSQL health and the alert mechanisms in place.

## 10. Email Notifications and PDF Reporting

### Daily Reports
Generation and delivery of daily stock and sales reports as PDFs via email.

### Forget-Password Functionality
Implementation of an OTP-based password reset process to enhance security.

## 11. Caching with Redis

### Redis Integration
Redis is commonly used as a caching layer between the application and the database, significantly reducing the load on the primary database, improving response times, and enhancing overall application performance.

## 12. Implementation Details
- **Micro-service Communication**: Using RabbitMQ for efficient inter-service communication.
- **Payment Processing**: Integrating Stripe for secure payment processing.
- **QR Code Generation**: Code snippets for generating QR codes during payment.
- **OTP Generation**: Generating OTP for secure password resets.
- **Email and PDF Generation**: Code implementation for generating and sending reports.
- **Socket.IO Integration**: Real-time event handling and communication examples.
- **Swagger Integration**: Utilizing Swagger decorators to automatically generate API documentation.

## 13. Challenges and Solutions
- **Scalability**: Addressing scalability challenges in a micro-services architecture.
- **Data Consistency**: Ensuring data consistency across micro-services, especially with real-time updates.
- **Security**: Mitigating security concerns, particularly in payment processing and authentication.
- **Real-Time Communication**: Overcoming challenges related to maintaining efficient real-time features with Socket.IO.

## 14. Performance Optimization
- **Caching with Redis**: Caching frequently accessed data to reduce the need to query the database repeatedly.
- **Database Optimization**: Caching frequently accessed data to decrease latency.
- **Micro-services Performance**: Ensuring micro-services are loosely coupled and independently deployable.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Handling tasks asynchronously to avoid blocking operations, ensuring the system remains responsive under heavy load.
- **Real-Time Performance**: Ensuring Socket.IO handles high-frequency events efficiently without degrading overall system performance.
